## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080, you must first run the data provider project on https://github.com/hedco-dev/Magic-Photo-Provider on port 5000 and use a smart way to render items in the gallery.
npm start

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080, it does not need to use local data provider and call target API directly and also have so simple way to render items in gallery.
npm run dev2

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit
